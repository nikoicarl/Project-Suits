# PROJECT “SUITS”

## Introduction

### A. Project Overview
In today’s evolving digital era, Pearson Specter is embarking on the journey to transition from paper-based documentation to an efficient electronic system. This proposal outlines the scopes, objectives, recommendations, and outcomes for the development of a web-based platform to meet the needs of the firm.

## Scope

### General Project Information
Project “Suits” aims to create a centralized platform for all the employees of Pearson Specter where, through Role-Based Access Control, they get streamlined access to essential documents.

### Problem/Opportunity Statement
Employees have to call their assistants or run themselves to the copy room every time they forget a document. What if there was a system where they could just upload their document and access it whenever they want? This project targets this problem and is a robust solution for all the employees of Pearson Specter.

### Project Objectives
- Design and implement a user-friendly website interface for Pearson Specter employees.
- Integrate Role-Based Access Control functionality to ensure secure document access.
- Develop a robust backend system for document management and storage.
- Provide comprehensive training and support for employees to effectively utilize the platform.

## Project Description
Development of this project will include creating a website for Pearson Specter, where all employees, using their unique employee ID, can sign in and based on their job roles and position, access the material required for any occasion. Using cutting-edge Role-Based Access Control Technology, security and integrity will be assured.

## Business Benefits
- Increased productivity: Employees will spend less time searching for documents, leading to improved efficiency.
- Enhanced data security: Role-Based Access Control will restrict document access to authorized personnel only, minimizing the risk of data breaches.
- Streamlined document management: Centralized storage and organization of documents will simplify administrative tasks and reduce errors.
- Competitive advantage: Demonstrating a commitment to technological innovation and employee welfare can enhance the company's reputation and attract top talent.

## Project Deliverables
- Fully functional website with an intuitive user interface.
- Role-Based Access Control system integrated into the platform.
- Backend infrastructure for document management and storage.
- Comprehensive user documentation and training materials.
- Ongoing support and maintenance plan for the website.

## Estimated Project Duration
This project development team aims to complete this project within 4 months from May 2024, i.e., by 12 Aug 2024. This timeline will include every stage of development utilizing all phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): Planning, Requirement Gathering and Analysis, Design, Implementation, Testing, Development, and Maintenance.

## System Description

### A. Alternatives
For developing an electronic documentation system for Pearson Specter, various alternative solutions like off-the-shelf software (pre-built software) and custom development were considered. After a careful evaluation, a web-based application was considered the best solution for meeting the requirements of the firm by ensuring seamless functionality, scalability, and reliability in the firm.

### B. Narrative of Input Information and Tasks Performed
- The system will be a web-based application that can be accessed through web browsers across different devices.
- The system will include a login environment where the users can sign in according to their credentials.
- The system will consist of various legal documents such as agreements, case status, contracts, evidence, court filings, and client meetings which will be uploaded by users through the integration of external databases.
- Users will upload the documents using the relevant data such as document type, client number, and case number.
- Users will access the folders or documents in the system according to their access rights and can edit or delete as per the requirement.
- Users will easily locate and access the desired documents using keywords, document type, or client name.

### Resultant
- The new system will provide access to documents in an organized, searchable repository which will facilitate efficient document management and collaboration.
- The system will be user-friendly and easy to navigate.
- The system will protect the security of documents and personal information.

## Feasibility Assessment

### Economic Feasibility
- Cost-benefit Analysis: This will include development, maintenance, and overhead expenses while installing a new system. The return on investment calculation will be done by taking into account tangible (cost savings, revenue generation) and intangible factors (user satisfaction, competitive advantage).

### Technical Feasibility
- A whole new IT infrastructure, hardware, and software will be installed to develop the electronic documentation system. There can exist some disruptions at first, but can be solved by ensuring the appropriate integration with the database and a proper assessment of the new technology. The scalability and performance of the system will be assessed timely so that future growth with a lot of documents can be accommodated along with optimal performance.

### Legal and Contractual Feasibility
- According to our plan, the new system will be developed by us so there will be no issues related to copyrights, ownership, or intellectual property rights.

### Political Analysis
- To develop the electronic documentation system, the communication between the stakeholders will be done effectively so that the goals and expectations are aligned among the members. In addition to this, training and support will be provided to the users, so the agenda of collaboration and innovation is maintained.

### Operational Analysis
- The focus of our plan is to make the documentation electronic, and for gathering the feedback or issues related to the new system, the conduction of user surveys will be done. While implementing the system, different kinds of user errors or system failures can exist which will be resolved by making new risk mitigation strategies and plans which will ensure streamlined operations within the law firm.

### Schedule Analysis
- Our main focus is to complete the project in 4 months (approx). All adequate financial and human resources will be ensured so that the project deadlines and milestones can be achieved with minimal schedule disruptions. Every factor such as deployment, testing, training, and user adoption is considered to develop a realistic project timeline.
